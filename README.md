# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## React Tripeaks

I used VS Code and React to write the standard solitary card game Tripeaks.

You can view it working here

## Add ons

- Dynamic scaling - when screen is resized, resize the card size, and placement
- Sound - added some sounds to make play more interesting
